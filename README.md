## The challenge

In this front-end development project, my challenge is to create a Social Media Dashboard with a theme switcher feature, aiming to closely match the provided design. I have the freedom to utilize any tools I prefer to accomplish this challenge, allowing for personal practice and experimentation.

Key Objectives:

1- Responsive Design: My goal is to develop the dashboard to display optimally across various device screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience regardless of the device being used.<br><br>
2- Interactive Elements: I will implement hover states for all interactive elements within the dashboard, enhancing user engagement and providing visual feedback upon interaction.<br><br>
3- Theme Switcher: I aim to enable users to toggle between different color themes according to their preferences, offering customization options to enhance user satisfaction and accessibility.<br><br>
4- By achieving these objectives, I aim to deliver a visually appealing, user-friendly Social Media Dashboard that offers a seamless experience across different devices and allows for personalization through theme customization.
